# Panopto Downloader â€“ Batch Downloader for Your Lectures

This is a Google Chrome extension designed for students who are tired of having to individually download, name and organise their lectures especially when there is over 150 possible lectures to download a semester.

## It's as easy as 3 steps now!
1. Pick your subject
2. Select the lectures you would like to download
3. Trigger a batch download

## Implementation

This was my second application. It injects JQuery into the page which allows us to scrape the download link for each subject the user has.
For styling JQuery components such as Select2 were used to create a robust user experience

## Note this application has been deprecated due to the university no longer investing in this platform
